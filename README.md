# SneakyRooks
This program involves efficiently determining whether any of the rooks on an arbitrarily large square chess board can attack one another using a solution with a worst-case runtime of O(m + n).

Users are given a list of coordinate strings for rooks on an arbitrarily large square chess board, and the program determines whether any of the rooks can attack one another in the given configuration. In the game of chess, rooks can move any number of spaces horizontally or vertically (up, down, left, or right). 

This program reinforces algorithmic and clever thinking and direct application of base conversion.
